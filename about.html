			<p><em>Why call it bootstrap?</em>
More than the definition and the way it's used development circles, bootstrap invokes for me  a spirit of can do and self reliance. Being an entrepreneur or business owner takes grit, determination and e every now and then the need and ability to pull yourself up by them.

A bootstrap is only helpful on a boot, and boots are a strong symbol of the southwest. From cowboys to bikers, boots are valuable and sturdy companion.  I want my clients to think of bootstrap technology the same way I think about my boots. Dependable, comfortable, daring, and outside the norm.

Ride safe, t.</p>
