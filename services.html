				<p>There are three options for services from BootStrap Technology.</p> 
				
				
				<p>First, there is the <strong>App Builder</strong> program. Got an idea?  Need an prototype for funding?  Want something you can take over once it's complete?  This is the program for you.  We schedule 30 minutes to talk with you about what you got running around in your head.  If we can help you and you like us, we schedule a <em>bootstrap user story session</em>.  This will set you back $200.  You get a written development plan in return, describing the estimated costs and timing to get you what you want.  You can take this development plan to any developer to have them look at and quote.  It's yours.  If you decide to go with us, we take 50% of the estimate up front and the balance when we are done and you are happy.  Guaranteed.</p>

				<p>The second is - <strong>CTO TimeShare</strong> - a comprehensive technology outsourcing program.  CTO Timeshare is designed to maximize your web technology and infrastructure investment.  It's all inclusive, and includes up to 3 hours of technology and business consulting per <em>month</em>.  CTO Timeshare is a A to Z solution that puts your web technology infrastructure into our experienced hands.</p>

			<p>Why Should I Outsource my CTO and technology management?</p>
			<p>Economies of scale and information sharing. That's why.  Chances are you and/or your company have the same challenges that other BT clients have.  When we solve a problem for them, we also solve it for you.  Every BT client benefits from this intellectual leverage...in effect like any timeshare, get the full benefit and only pay for what you use.</p>
