				<p>There are three basic options for IT consulting from BootStrap Technology. The first is - <strong>CTO Timeshare</strong> - a comprehensive technology outsourcing program.  CTO Timeshare is designed to maximize your technology and support investment.  It's all inclusive, and includes up to 3 hours of technology consulting per <em>month</em>.  CTO Timeshare is a A to Z solution that puts your technology infrastructure into our experienced hands.  See the table b</p>
<p>Or you can choose to engage us on a per hour consultancy basis.  This option is ideal for companies and entrepreneurs that have an new idea or want some out of the box thinking and strategizing.  It's ad-hoc and tailored to your needs and budget.</p>
<p>Finally, there is our App Builder program. Got an idea?  Need an prototype for funding?  Want something you can take over once complete?  This is the program for you.  We schedule 30 minutes to talk with you about what you got running around your head.  If we can help you and you like us, we schedule a <em>bootstrap user story session</em>.  This will set you back $200.  You get a a written development plan in return describing the estimated costs to get what you want.  You can take this plan to any developer to have them look at and quote.  Its yours.  If you go with us, we take 50% of the estimate up front and the balance when we are done and you are happy.  Guaranteed.</p>

			<p>Why Should I OutSource my CTO and technology management?</p>
			<p>Economies of scale and information sharing. That's why.  Chances are you and/or your company have the same challenges that other BT clients have.  When we solve a problem for them, we also solve it for you.  Every BT client benefits from intellectual leverage..   </p>
