			<h3>Why Call it Bootstrap?</h3>
<p>More than the definition and the way it's used development circles, bootstrap invokes for me a spirit of can do and self reliance. Being an entrepreneur or business owner takes grit, determination and every now and then the need and ability to pull yourself up by them.

A bootstrap is only helpful on a boot, and boots are a strong symbol of the southwest. From cowboys to bikers, boots are valuable and sturdy companion.  I want my clients to think of bootstrap technology the same way I think about my boots. Dependable, comfortable, daring, and outside the norm.</p>
